# CCC151
Information Management

The purpose of this code is to implement the CRUDL functions. A brute-force or
a persistent way of storing datas. CRUDL stands for Create, Read, Update,
Delete, and show the list of datas that are stored.

Make sure to install Python 3.7 and Tkinter package in your computer.

I acknowlege that I have used other people's ideas in creating this code.


# CSV database is being used in this code
